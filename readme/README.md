IZ*ONE Fan Websites

---

Project Overview:
This project is a fully designed multi-page fan website dedicated to the global K-pop group IZ*ONE. It showcases the group’s about, members, albums, merchandise, ticket information, and ways for fans to connect through a smooth and engaging browsing experience.

The goal of the project is to recreate a clean, and responsive fan site that feels both informative and visually appealing. The content is organized clearly so users can easily explore media, view products, learn about the members, and interact with different features. Essentially, this website acts as a digital hub for fans while demonstrating strong UI/UX fundamentals, good layout structure, and solid front-end planning.

Design Process:
The website was created with the intention of both new fans and existing WIZ*ONE supporters in mind. Users visiting the site want quick access to:

- Group information and history
- Member profiles
- Albums and multimedia
- Merchandise and ticket details
- A simple way to contact the site owner

The site design focuses on clarity, responsiveness, and easy navigation, ensuring that users reach their goals with minimal steps.
